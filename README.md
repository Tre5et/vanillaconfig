# VanillaConfig by TreSet

## Description

A config API that allows for easy and flexible loading and saving of mod configs and generates vanilla-like config screens.

## If you are a user, don't worry about this mod

It only does anything when installed with mod that depend on it. On its own it is useless.
Only install this mod if another mod tells you to do so.
You also need to install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) with this mod.
